### What I am up to?🎯
An undergoing Computer Science & Engineering graduate,I aspire to become a Machine Learning Engineer and built something as crazy as JARVIS🤖. A constant learner and team builder, who also likes to tinker with hardware(IOT).

### What are my skills?👨‍💻
- I have a strong hold on **Python**🐍, **Java**♨ and a quite good knowledge in **C++**.

- It was towards the end of 2019 I began my **Machine Learning & Data Science** journey which is still being continued. Currently I am into **Deep Learning**,learning **Data      Structures & Algorithms** & **Robotic Process Automation** with UiPath.

- As part of learning how to deploy machine learning models, I have also touched my hand on **Django & Flask**. Since I am also quite good in **SQL**, I myself consider me as a 'little **Backend developer**' too.

### Familiar Operating Systems🖥
- Being an immense linux fan boy🐧, I always use linux in my development. 
- Has a good experience in working **Arch Linux(my favourite & daily driver)** , **Ubuntu** and **Windows**(sure😂?)
